                <p>Indonesia's surge in nickel mining – a mineral critical for batteries – highlights a fraught energy transition dilemma. Global demand for electric vehicles has driven "soaring demand for nickel" to support a low-carbon future, but the local impacts are stark. A recent analysis found that deforestation doubled in nickel-mining villages on Sulawesi, and community well-being fell: education outcomes, living standards and environmental quality declined even as some infrastructure and health metrics briefly improved. These mixed results "underscore the need for greater accountability of local outcomes" if the clean-energy transition is to be equitable and sustainable. In other words, winners (battery manufacturers, national economies) are accruing benefits, while local forests and poor communities may bear new burdens. This pattern mirrors the broader "winners and losers" dynamic of decarbonization: cleaner energy brings jobs and growth for some, but can perpetuate inequities for others.</p>

                <h2>The Promise and Limitations of Current Geospatial Tools</h2>
                
                <p>Advanced data tools promise to help navigate such trade-offs, but current approaches fall short. Satellite remote sensing and GIS are already revolutionizing energy planning – researchers note they "are already being applied to a wide range of energy issues," from mapping renewable sites to tracking rural electrification and verifying emissions targets. In fact, satellite data can even reveal patterns of energy injustice: new studies show how day/night lights and other imagery help identify who has electricity and who doesn't, and how access changes over time. For example, combining nighttime light data with settlement maps has been used to estimate where electrification lags.</p>

                <p>Public and private platforms have sprung up on this potential:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Energy Access Explorer (WRI):</strong> A free, open-source GIS platform synthesizing 50+ datasets on supply, demand, demographics and infrastructure. It uses multi-criteria analysis and overlays to highlight underserved areas where solar, grid extension or clean cooking could make an impact.</p>
                
                <p><strong>NREL's Geospatial Tools:</strong> The U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab hosts mapping tools for resources (solar, wind, etc.), land use, and infrastructure. Their geospatial science "uses GIS to produce maps, analyses, models…that inform energy planning" for renewables deployment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Private Analytics (e.g. Kayrros):</strong> Commercial firms leverage satellite imagery and AI to monitor energy assets and greenhouse gas flows in near-real time – for example, tracking oil shipments or methane leaks.</p>

                <p>These tools provide invaluable foresight on resource potential and investment gaps. Energy Access Explorer even incorporates census and wealth-index layers, helping planners gauge consumer need. But none of these platforms "remembers" what happened after projects were built. They typically focus on biophysical supply and demand metrics, or best-case modeling of new projects. They lack granular social outcomes. In practice, we cannot yet click on an oil well in a map and see how the local fishing yields or school attendance changed afterwards. In short, current tools model the "what could be" in generic terms, but not the "what has been" in specific locales.</p>

                <h2>Learning from Indonesia's Nickel Mining Experience</h2>
                
                <p>This gap means we miss crucial lessons from the past. Indonesia's nickel boom illustrates why. Conventional project screening might note that nickel is a green-economy resource and that Sulawesi has forests (even overlaying preliminary conservation maps). But it doesn't see the full picture without remembering history. In Sulawesi, the surge in nickel mining led to vast road-building into remote forests, illegal logging and water pollution. In villages already in poverty, the study found environmental well-being continued to deteriorate in the later stages of mining – a signal of long-term harm that only emerges by looking at multi-year data. Yet today's planning dashboards wouldn't flag this. They might show a new concession in Sulawesi on top of mineral and topographic layers, but they don't automatically flag "score one for deforestation risk – look up Lo et al. 2024".</p>

                <h2>Proposing a Spatial Memory Platform</h2>
                
                <p>To make the energy transition fairer, we propose a "spatial memory" platform – an AI-assisted geospatial system that integrates past and present data for each site. Think of it as a "digital twin" for locations: it would compile satellite imagery over time, local infrastructure maps (mines, roads, pipelines), and village-level social indicators (health, education, demographics) into a unified database. Machine learning could then detect patterns and flag risks. For instance, if villages near earlier projects saw water quality drops or school closures, the AI would learn those signals. Before approving a new mine or gas well, planners could query the system to see analogous cases and probable outcomes. The platform would let investors and policymakers visualize history, not just resources.</p>

                <p>Concretely, such a spatial memory might:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Track land-cover change over time</strong> at every project site using satellite time-series, flagging forest loss or pollution.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cross-link infrastructure maps</strong> (mining concessions, power lines, roads) with socioeconomic data from surveys or census, to show if schools, clinics or fields were later built or destroyed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Apply AI to spot "red flag" signals</strong> – e.g. a cluster of health complaints following new mining operations – by correlating past project locations with local well-being trends.</p>

                <p>Combining diverse data like this – what the Frontiers review calls creating "a more complete picture of the energy system" – could reveal hidden injustices. Energy planners could see not only where demand and resources align, but also where past investments delivered uneven benefits. For example, the system might learn that building a coal plant in a floodplain repeatedly displaced fishermen (a spatial-memory pattern), whereas solar projects in similar regions avoided social disruption.</p>

                <h2>Site-Specific Learning for Energy Justice</h2>
                
                <p>The novelty of this approach is its site-specific learning. Unlike existing tools, it explicitly uses retrospective outcomes to inform future siting. It treats each project location as having a "memory" – a record of what happened there. This aligns with the idea that energy justice requires knowing who wins and who loses. By making data on past impacts transparent and spatially explicit, a memory platform would empower local communities to hold investors accountable. It would also sharpen risk assessments for investors: a company could quantify the odds of local opposition or ecological fines in a new venture by analyzing similar historical cases.</p>

                <h2>Implementation Pathway</h2>
                
                <p>Implementing this vision requires partnerships and data sharing. Governments and NGOs should archive project outcomes (environmental surveys, social assessments) in open databases. Satellite imagery (now cheaper and more frequent than ever) can feed into cloud platforms. Open-source AI models, trained on well-studied regions like Sulawesi, could be adapted to new geographies. Crucially, local stakeholders must help interpret results – a satellite pixel showing "bare ground" may mean different things (monoculture vs. mine vs. natural dry season).</p>

                <h2>Conclusion: Bridging Technical Resources with Human Realities</h2>
                
                <p>As the Global South rushes to upgrade energy systems, forgetting the past could deepen inequalities under the guise of progress. We have the technology to do better. A spatial memory platform would harness remote sensing, geospatial data and AI to remember the impacts of past investments – making sure today's choices do not repeat yesterday's mistakes. In practice, this means asking not only "Where should we build?" but also "What happened the last time we built there?" It is a call to policymakers, investors, and researchers to develop integrated planning tools that bridge technical resources with human realities. Only by embedding memory into our models can we steer the energy transition toward both climate goals and social justice, truly leaving no one behind.</p>

                <h2>Sources</h2>
                
                <p>Recent literature highlights the role of satellite data in energy planning and documents Indonesia's nickel mining impacts on forests and communities<sup>1,2,3,10</sup>. Existing GIS platforms (e.g. WRI's Energy Access Explorer) combine supply–demand layers<sup>4,11</sup>, and NREL provides mapping tools for renewables<sup>8,9</sup>, but none integrate on-the-ground outcomes. Our proposal draws on these works and on the emerging scholarship of energy justice to chart a more holistic path forward.</p>
